  . Why Should I Use Calendars In Project Management Software?
Calendars are useful tools for keeping track of upcoming meetings, deadlines, and milestones. They can help you visualize your schedule and remind you of important events, such as holidays and vacation time.It’s no wonder that people often have a variety of calendar tools to choose from, including everything from a paper calendar on their office wall to a calendar management tool, such as Calendly.
The problem is that people too often manage multiple calendars at once. When these calendars aren’t integrated with your work and synchronized with each other, this can lead to mass confusion, headaches, and missed deadlines. 
 
 .WhO should use a project management software calendar
If you’re already managing and updating one or more calendars, you may not consider calendar functionality an important feature of project management software. However, a project management software solution that includes calendars offers several benefits that other calendar options do not.
For instance, traditional calendars are great for planning your day, but terrible for planning, visualizing, and sharing project work.While your online calendar may remind you of an upcoming deadline, it’s not designed to tell you what tasks are required to meet the deadline, who’s working on them, and what their current status of completion is. You would need to go outside that program (or send an email request) to find that critical information.

       .Proper calendaring (or in other words, knowing when your workforce is available for work) is important during all phases of project management, from the initial proposal & budget work-up, to the final analysis conducted once the project is complete.
        While your organization may have a standard working calendar (start/end times, company days off, corporate holidays, etc.), it’s important to realize that individuals - and even materials - can have unique calendars that will deviate from the standard one used by your organization, and if not taken into consideration, can skew any plan calculations significantly.
